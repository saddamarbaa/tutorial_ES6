/*
Promise Intro
- Promise Is One Of The Best Features In ES6
- Promise Make It Easy To Support Asynchronous Programming
- Promise in JavaScript Is Like Promise in Real Life
- Promise Is Something That Will Happen in The Future
- Promise Is A Placeholder For A Future Value
- You Booked A Cinema Ticket, You Have A Promise From Cinema Owner 2 Have A Seat
- You Got Task To Do, U Promised Your Boss To Do The Task
- You Ordered Food From Restaurant
--- [ Promise ] Is The Order Record
--- [ The Future Value ] Is The Food You Will Receive
- You Ordered iPhone From Souq Shop
--- [ Promise ] Is The Order Record
--- [ The Future Value ] Is The iPhone You Will Receive
- Promise Is An Object
- Promise Is The Event Completion Or Failure of Async Operation & Its Resulting Value.
- JavaScript Use Callbacks For Asynchronous Programming
--- [1] Function Called And Do The Task
--- [2] Action Complete
--- [3] Another Function Called
--- [4] Action Complete
--- [5] Another Function Called
- In Complex Cases => Every Call Add Nesting Level

- Promise Avoiding Callback Hell Or Pyramid Of Doom
- Promise Is One Of This States
[1] Pending => Not Fulfilled Or Rejected
[2] Fulfilled => Operation Succeeded
[3] Rejected => Operation Failed
*/

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
// console.log("Welcome To My First Promise");
/*
Asynchronous Operation
Fulfilled => resolve
Rejected => reject
*/

// let connect = false;
let connect = true;
if (connect) {
resolve("Connection Established");
} else {
reject(Error("Connection Failed"));
}
}).then(
(resolved) => console.log(resolved),
(rejected) => console.log(rejected)
);

console.log(typeof myPromise);

// Another Syntax

const theResolved = (resolved) => console.log(resolved);
const therejected = (rejected) => console.log(rejected);

myPromise.then(theResolved, therejected);

// Then And Catch And Training

const demoPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
// only one State Allowed
// resolve("resolved");
// reject("Rjected"); // Igonored

if (Math.random() * 100 < 87) {
resolve("Good Luck");
} else {
reject("Bad Luck");
}
});

// demoPromise.then(
//   (resolved) => console.log(resolved),
//   (rejected) => console.log(rejected)
// );

// demoPromise.then((resolved) => console.log(resolved));
// demoPromise.catch((rejected) => console.log(rejected));

demoPromise.then((resolved) => console.log(resolved));
demoPromise.catch((rejected) => console.log(rejected));
